# wl-pprint

This is a pretty printing library for Idris based on Phil Wadler's paper _A Prettier Printer_ and on Daan Leijen's extensions in the Haskell `wl-pprint` library. See the IdrisDoc for specific documentation.

Originally authored by Daan Leijen, the code has been ported to Idris by Shayan Najd and David Christiansen.

If you have issues or suggestions, please send pull requests or open issues on this repository.

To run what rudimentary tests are present, type `idris --testpkg wl-pprint.ipkg`.
